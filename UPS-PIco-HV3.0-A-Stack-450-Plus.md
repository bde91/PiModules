# UPS PIco HV3.0 A Stack 450 **Plus**

UPS PIco HV3.0 A Stack 450 **Plus** is an advanced uninterruptible power supply for the Raspberry Pi A+/B+/2/3, that adds a wealth of innovative power back-up functionality and development features to the innovative microcomputer! The UPS PIco will automatically shut-down your Raspberry Pi if there is a power failure, and can be set to automatically monitor and reboot your Pi once power has been restored!

The UPS PIco HV3.0A Stack **Plus** version features a 5V 3A output, designed for use on the latest Raspberry Pi 3!

In addition to all the features contained in the standard UPS PIco, the UPS PIco HV3.0A Stack **Plus** features the following:

* **Extended Voltage Input 7 - 28V DC** - Protected with Zero Voltage Drop Inverse Polarity Protection, PPTC Over-current, and ESD. Ideal for Cars, Trucks, Buses and any industrial high voltage applications.
* **Dynamic Power Tracking (DPT)** - Charges the battery according to available input power from 100 mA - 1200 mA. DPT checks the input current every second, and adjusts the charging current based on this value making it ideal for Solar Panel applications.
* **Bi Stable (Zero Power) Relay** - With dual separated independent contacts
* **Optical Isolated Input (Opto-Coupler)** – Readable as A/D values

The UPS PIco is equipped with a 450mAh LiPO battery specially designed to enable safe shutdown during a power cut. Additionally, this can be easily upgraded to the extended 4000mAh or 8000mAh versions, which enables prolonged use of a Raspberry Pi for up to 16 hours without a power supply connected!

The UPS PIco features an embedded measurement system that continuously checks the powering voltage of the Raspberry Pi. When the cable power on the Raspberry Pi is absent, insufficient, or the device detects a power failure, the UPS Pico automatically switches to the unit’s battery source. The module then continues to check the voltage on the Pi and switches automatically back to the regular cable supply when power is once again available.

The UPS PIco is powered and the battery pack intelligently charged via the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi, so no additional cabling or power supply is required. Because the UPS Pico requires no external powering and fits within the footprint of the Raspberry Pi, it is compatible with most cases.

The UPS PIco can also be equipped with an optional Infra-Red Receiver which is routed directly to GPIO18 via the PCB for remote IR operations. Additionally the PIco includes an Automatic Temperature Control PWM FAN controller, and can be equipped with a Micro Fan Kit, which enables the use of the Raspberry Pi in extreme conditions including very high temperature environments. The UPS PIco is designed to be 100% compliant with HAT standards for the Raspberry Pi and includes a Gold Plated Reset Pin, with install locations for the Raspberry Pi Zero, B+/2 and 3.
