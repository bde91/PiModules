# UPS PIco HV3.0A
## Uninterruptible Power Supply with Peripherals and I2C control Interface
### Designed for the Raspberry Pi® 3 and Fully Compatible with Raspberry Pi® 2, Pi Zero, A+, B+. HAT Compliant.

The UPS PIco HV3.0A is an advanced uninterruptible power supply for the Raspberry Pi® 3 that adds a wealth of innovative power back-up functionality and development features to the innovative micro-computer!

Especially designed for the Raspberry Pi® 3 but also compatible with all other models; offers now 3A current from the External Power Supply or battery backup, 3 User Keys, 3 User LEDs, 3 different types of high capacity batteries, 2 x 3 pins bi-stable relay (Zero Power), as also 3 x A/D 12 bit converters pre-adjusted to 5V, 15V and 30V conversion. Now, with additional External Supply Powering Input; that have implemented Dynamic Power Tracking; automatically adjust battery charging current according to power availability from  50mA – 1000 mAh. This feature has been especially designed to support Solar Panel Powering Raspberry Pi® Systems, as it is adjusting the charging battery current to available Sunning conditions. The External Supply Powering Input is able to accept power from 7 V DC up to 28 V DC !! Thus make it ideal for Cars, Trucks, Buses and any industrial applications where voltage is usually higher than 24V DC. The External Supply Powering Input is equipped with Over Current protection, Over Voltage as also with Zero Voltage Drop Inverse Polarity Protection in order to use all available energy from the Solar Panel in case of use. The New UPS PIco HV3.0A is an all-in-one tool that allows implementing easy and fast simple applications as also complicated projects providing a set of pre installed peripherals.

The UPS PIco HV3.0A is standard equipped with a 450 mAh 15C LiPO battery specially designed to enable safe shutdown during cabled power cut and automatic system restart when cabled power comes back. The included battery provides enough energy to keep running system for 5-8 minutes. Additionally, this can be easily upgraded to the extended 4000mAh version, 8000 mAh as also 12000 mAh batteries (optional on special request), which enables prolonged use of a Raspberry Pi for more than 32 hours without a power supply connected (with biggest battery installed)!

The UPS PIco HV3.0A 450 mAh Stack Plus design support now batteries with different chemistry: LiPO as also LiFePO4. Especially the LiFePO4 batteries are addressed to applications where temperatures environment is more restricted as can be used for supplying from -10 degrees up to +60 degrees. In addition the LiFePO4 have a unique extremely long life of charging/discharging that can achieve up to 2000 cycles!!

The implemented trimmed Hardware Real Time Clock and Calendar, guarantees time stamp when system is running without access to the Network. The Hardware RTCC is backed up and powered from the integrated system battery. The RTCC current consumption is only 1 uA.

The integrated Hardware RTCC enables a new extremely usefully feature – the Events Triggered RTCC Based System Actions Scheduler. The Events Triggered RTCC Based System Actions Scheduler allows to timely start up, or shutdown the Raspberry Pi® on various internal or external events that include, 1-wire, IR, A/D, RTCC, temperature, Opto Coupled Input or just on requested Time Stamp.

Professional developers often need to protect their application. In order to support them UPS PIco HV3.0A offers the XTEA dual path encryption (on read and write path) embedded engine that protect the developed software with the secure code.
The UPS PIco HV3.0A 450 mAh Stack Plus offers 2.6A battery power backup for the Raspberry Pi® via GPIOs as also 3A extended power supply, but not only. In addition is offered an independent from the Raspberry Pi® powering, battery backed output of 5V@750 mA available for the user devices connected to the Raspberry Pi® that must be running even if the mother Raspberry Pi® is shut down and not powered (i.e. USB powered HUBs, WiFi Routers, Motion Detectors, HDDs etc). The total current can not exceed 3A. The current supply delivered via GPIOs to the Raspberry Pi® is 2.6A

Many applications need to have secondary RS232 in addition to the primary one offered by the Raspberry Pi®. Until today, it has been solved by users with add-on hardware put on the top. Not anymore !! With the UPS PIco HV3.0A user have access to integrated secondary serial port 3.3V level but save also to be used with 5V level. This makes the developed application cost effective and more robust. This software driver is under development and wil be delivered within 1 month after system delivery.

Now with additional Terminals Blocks Add-on UPS PIco HV3.0A 450 mAh Stack Plus offers a professional I/O connectivity for any industrial application including 12V level converter for both Serial Ports (one of them must be selected).
The Zero Power Bi Stable Relay offers two independent sets of NO terminals, offers up to 1A contacts able to switch ON/OFF various peripherals of the developed system. Due to unique design, no power is required when Bi Stable Relay is in Set/Reset state, making it ideal for battery powered applications.Two independent 3 pins sets offered (NC, NO, COM) are switched at the same time. 

Now, the high voltage signal can be monitored safetly with the Opto Coupled interface, which can be read as digital as also analogue input.

The IoT developers will find usefull the 3 ESD protected 12 bits buffered A/D converters as also number of internal sensors and sensor interfaces that can be used for system monitoring such as Battery Voltage, External Powering Voltage, Raspberry Pi Voltage, Current Consumption, System Temperature and 1-wire interface.

The UPS PIco HV3.0A can also be equipped with an optional Infra-Red Receiver which is routed directly to GPIO18 via the PCB. This opens the door for remote operation of the Raspberry Pi® and UPS Pico!

The embedded Electromagnetic Programmable Sounder can be used as a simple buzzer but also as music player due to implemented sound generator and dedicated programmer interface.

Finally, the UPS PIco HV3.0A features an implemented Automatic Temperature Control PWM FAN controller, and can be equipped with a micro fan kit, which enables the use of the Raspberry Pi® in extreme conditions including very high temperature environments. The FAN speed is automatically adjusted according to system temperature conditions semi linearly (8 levels) from 0 % (FAN is OFF) up to 100% by increasing and decreasing rotation speed. Thus guarantees the possible lowest level of noise and always cool Raspberry Pi® 3.
